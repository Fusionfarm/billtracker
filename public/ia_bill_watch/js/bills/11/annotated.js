The proposal would repeal the current law, which bars a person from using a hand-held electronic communication device to write, send, or read a text message while driving a motor vehicle and bans cell-phone use outright for young drivers. Current law is only enforceable as a secondary action when a peace officer stops or detains a driver for a suspected violation of another motor vehicle law.\r\nThis bill would establish a broader offense of driving while engaged in a distracting activity, which is defined to mean any activity that is not immediately necessary to the operation of the motor vehicle and that impairs, or could reasonably be expected to impair, the person\u2019s ability to drive safely. The bill specifies that the use of a wireless telephone is a distracting activity.\r\nA person convicted of driving while distracted would be guilty of a simple misdemeanor punishable by a scheduled fine of $30. There also are enhanced fines and licensure sanctions for texting violations involving an accident that caused property damage, serious injury or death ranging up to $1,000 and a 180-day license suspension.","topics":["Criminal Law","Transportation"]}
