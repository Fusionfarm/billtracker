215","reporter_description":"This bill is a major piece of the education reform package and would change how teachers are recruited, paid, evaluated and promoted. In addition to the 2 percent growth which was amended in the first debate of the bill, the House legislation dangles the promise of increased per student funding of roughly $300 to any school district that adopts new base pay and teacher career ladders called for in the bill.\r\nBranstad\u2019s proposal made the switch to career ladders mandatory, the House version makes it optional, but districts that don\u2019t opt-in don\u2019t get the extra $300. Several other amendments have been added to the initial draft of the bill.","topics":["Education"]}
